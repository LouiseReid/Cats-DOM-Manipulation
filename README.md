# Cats-DOM-Manipulation

1. Add JS code to allow a new cat to be added programmatically. Do it rough and ready at first!
2. Refactor the code to make it easy to add a new cat.
3. Remove the cat data in the HTML and add them via your javascript. Why not put the cat data into an array?
4. EXTENSION: use CSS to make things look "nice"!
